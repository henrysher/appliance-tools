1. APPLIANCE CREATOR DESIGN GOALS

This is a first cut the Appliance Creation Tool (ACT) a tool to create
Appliance Images from a kickstart file. This tool uses the liveCD
creator API as well as patches to the LIVECD API originally written by Daniel P. Berrange <berrange@redhat.com> to create a multi partitioned disk image. This Disk image can then be booted in a virtual container such as XEN, KVM, and VMWARE.


2. CREATING AN APPLIANCE IMAGE

To create an appliance image, the applinace-creator tool is used. Super user
privileges are needed. The tool is more or less self-documenting, use
the --help option to see options.
